Allies at Boston College serves as the gay-straight alliance for students. We work on campus to promote a better community for all students and faculty. 

On this new website we will post all of the important regarding our group including our meeting times, events, and other general news. After our first meeting (which will also be posted here), all of these juicy details will be decided!

Allies serves the role of a gay-straight alliance at Boston College. We are a group of GLBTQ and straight students working to foster a better community for everyone. Tolerance as an attitude towards someone of a different sexual orientation is not enough; the group promotes acceptance of all and equal rights. We all need to work together if we want to see change in our society and the community we live in, at BC and beyond the school. Allies tries to spark that  collaboration by holding events to help everyone be a better citizen and encourage people to see situations through someone elseâ€™s perspectives, generally every month. We believe everyone can be an ally; it is as easy as being an accepting person who treats everyone with respect regardless of sexual orientation or anything else. If this sounds like something you want to be a part of, join us. We are a group of friends as much as we are a club working for a better community and are always looking for new members.
